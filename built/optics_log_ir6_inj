--- work on beam1
1       matched IR6b1 with toolkit/rematch_ir6b1.madx - aperture not good enough -> match with toolkit/rematch_ir6b1m.madx
2       straight section above 9.6, DS still below
3       DS slightly optimized -> reaching the limit
--- work on beam2
4       beam 2 optics, straight section above 9.6 (approx.), DS partly optimized
5       beam 2 optics, aperture optimized in straight section, DS partly optimized, dropped dispersion and dmuxkickb2 constraint
6       restore phase advance and dispersion constraint
7       optimized aperture beam2
--- work on beam1
8       keep aperture constraint, try to restore phase advance: dmuxkickb1=0.26788, epsap=3.0
9       epsap=3.0, dmuxkickb1-0.25 = 0.0125
--- work on beam2
10      epsap=3.0, dmuxkickb1-0.25 = 0.0125 also fro beam 2 now -> good optics!
