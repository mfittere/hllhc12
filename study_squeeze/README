squeeze1: job_mksqueeze1.madx, *ir6b[12]m.madx, base optics: slhc/opt_presqueeze.madx
          - squeeze flat and round with rematching IR2/4/6/8 from scratch (not using v10)
          - IR6 with dump constraint (bxdumpb1,bydumpb1,dmuxkickb1) and beta @ MKD and TCDQ
squeeze2: job_mksqueeze2.madx, *ir6b[12]m.madx, base optics: slhc/opt_presqueeze.madx
          - use v10 squeeze files as template for ir2/4/6 (by mistake not 8), take previous
            more squeezed optics
          - IR6 no dump constraints (bxdumpb1,bydumpb1,dmuxkickb1) and no beta @ MKD and TCDQ
squeeze3: job_mksqueeze3.madx, *ir6b[12]m.madx, base optics: slhc/opt_presqueeze.madx
          - use v10 squeeze files as template for ir2/4/6 (by mistake not 8), interpolate linearly
            between squeeze points
          - IR6 no dump constraints (bxdumpb1,bydumpb1,dmuxkickb1) and no beta @ MKD and TCDQ
squeeze4: job_mksqueeze4.madx, *ir6b2m.madx, *ir6b1md.madx
          - IR2/4/8 as in squeeze3
          - IR6: use squeeze3 as starting point for IR6, beam2 already fine
            squeeze4a: base optics: slhc/opt_presqueeze.madx
                       linear interpolation until minimum betxdumpb1 is reached, then keep constant 
                       + constant betydumpb1
            squeeze4b: base optics: rematchir6/opt_presqueeze.madx
                       linear interpolation from maximum to minimum value for betxdumpb1
                       + constant betydumpb1
squeeze5: job_mksqueeze5.madx, *ir6b2m.madx, *ir6b1md.madx
         - IR2/4/8 as in squeeze3
         - IR6: use squeeze4b as starting point for IR6, find smoother transition between presqueezed
                and squeezed optics by using linear fit to b[xy]dumpb1
squeeze6: job_mksqueeze6.madx, *ir6b2.madx, *ir6b1.madx
         - IR2/4/8 as in squeeze3
         - IR6: interpolate beta at IP6 from squeeze5 (see plots in squeeze5/*)
